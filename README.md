Code and instructions for pre-processing and statistical analysis of evoked pupillary responses used in the research paper **Pupillary dynamics reflect age-related changes in memory encoding**. 

The aim of the EyeCog study (CNRS, ID-RCB 2021-A02686-35) was to investigate the link between pupillary marker and cognitive performance, and the evolution of this relationship in non-pathological aging. Pupil data were obtained from the **EyeBrain T2 eyetracker** from Suricog (Paris, France).

All the code was written on **Matlab**. A graphical interface based on Matlab's AppDesigner is available for those who don't want to go into the code but would like to reproduce the analyses üòâ. If you're a Matlab or object-oriented enthusiast, you'll quickly notice that the code isn't optimized... but it works! :smirk:

For the moment, the code is **adapted only to data from the EyeBrain T2 eyetracker**, and no other device :bow:. However, you are completely free to appropriate and modify the code provided to adapt it to other eyetrackers or rewrite it in another language (GNU GPL-3.0 license). 

There are already pupil data analysis scripts and libraries online, but perhaps my contribution can encourage others to improve on my work or even propose a universal matlab pipeline, all accompanied by an easy-to-use interface üòè.
